Environment variables (env) are essential in Kubernetes and software development in general for several reasons:

Configuration Flexibility: Environment variables provide a flexible way to configure applications without requiring code changes or recompilation. This flexibility allows you to customize application behavior based on the environment in which it runs (e.g., development, staging, production) or specific deployment requirements.

Security: Environment variables are often used to store sensitive information such as API keys, database passwords, or other credentials. They provide a more secure alternative to hardcoding sensitive information directly into application code or configuration files, reducing the risk of exposing credentials.
